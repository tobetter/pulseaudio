2007-10-25	Tanu Kaskinen
	7ccf40e: Add "support" for plugins that have control output ports, i.e. don't crash on them anymore (the plugins correctly assume that every port is connected to a buffer, so we connect them to a dummy buffer that isn't used anywhere).

2007-09-28	Pierre Ossman
	bdf9746: Update module-solaris to new structure.
	6d8aea7: Incorrectly used str2sig() instead of sig2str().

2007-09-28	Lennart Poettering
	67b899a: treat timer_enabled like a real, grown-up boolean variable
	33f2f49: rework module-combine once again. We now run the data generation always in a seperate thread. This should help use to avoid all the awful race conditions we had in previously
	229afb5: Move the poll() call outside the #ifdef checking for ppoll, since we want the poll in all cases. Prior to this change the check for negative return values of poll/ppoll was never actually executed when ppoll() was available
	f8c1786: use the full range of RTSIGS for our stuff
	3cdff5f: Allocate rtsigs from back to front, to avoid clashes with other libraries makeing use of rtsigs
	df33b4c: only do IO if we are RUNNING or IDLE, but not when we are in INIT
	584ca61: don't free silence memblocks that don't exist

	1687226: fix make dist

2007-09-24	Lennart Poettering
	86ec421: fix suspending in module-combine.c
	609ad12: * decouple suspending of monitor sources and their sinks
	0e3e9e2: only post data into the monitor source when it is not suspended
	f0f9df9: * add new state changed hook for streams
	ac86fa1: fix IDLE vs. RUNNING state handling of sinks/sources when changing cork status for streams
	3c75d35: rework zeroconf service publishing, to use synchronous hooks instead of asynchronous subscription events. Don't push autoload entries anymore.
	e37fa01: add hooks for name/description changes of sinks/source and streams
	ef020c6: fix stream corking: ignore pa_sink_input() when we are in corked state
	55651ec: don't count streams using the monitor source in pa_sink_used_by(), because this would disallow suspending a sink ehn an rtp stream is connected
	ba322a4: drop the PA_SOURCE_CAN_SUSPEND and PA_SINK_CAN_SUSPEND flags, since they were a bad idea in the first place. All sinks/sources are now *required* to handle suspending in one way or another. Luckily all current sink/source implementations handle it fine anyway.

2007-09-23	Lennart Poettering
	77ed60c: instead of using the mixer ioctl()s on the dsp fd, open a seperate fd for the mixer. This allows us the keep the mixer fd open while closing the dsp device while suspending.
	fc00eaf: use O_NOFOLLOW when creating lock files, too
	2860685: use O_NOFOLLOW when creating PID file, to avoid symlink vulnerability

2007-09-23	Tanu Kaskinen
	de079ac: Added an assertion for the case when the sink programmer hasn't installed the thread_mq properly.
	7bcbf16: Comment typo fix.

2007-09-22	Tanu Kaskinen
	ecad937: Fix the assignment of control values by using the right variable for indexing.
	1c44be2: Correct the parameter positions with the pa_cvolume_set() call.

2007-09-22	Lennart Poettering
	e04a857: minor optimization

	c40c168: maintain the attach status in a boolean variable 'attach' accessible from the IO thread for sink_inputs/source_outputs

2007-09-19	Lennart Poettering
	75647bc: render new data always in the master sink's thread, fixing missing locking
	a8a9ee4: make sure we initialize thread private data before we move our ghost sink to the rt thread, not after
	42b71ff: fix trivial typo
	d716e3c: fix check for lrintf, make resample2.c again identical to upstream ffmpeg
	75f799a: make O_CLOEXEC, O_NONBLOCK and socket low latency fd ops more uniform: always return void, name them similarly, only pass a single fd
	0fcad97: copy free_cb into a temporary variable first, to avoid compiler warning

2007-09-18	Lennart Poettering
	ac66b6a: fall back to plughw:, if hw: doesn't work, in the alsa source, too
	781cf49: properly release memblock always abd as soon as possible
	1fd9afd: make use of pa_bool_t on a few places where applicable; really start work_cb
	b3093d8: lower SO_PRIORITY priority to 6, since this is the best we get without being root
	ef8df41: make rtp send socket low delay
	f44ddd1: add new pa_socket_udp_low_delay() API
	6b2fd23: add two missing header file inclusions

	ca71764: If PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT mutexes are not available fall back to normal mutexes
	a558e93: port module-rtp-send.c to lock-free core
	08d4b23: actually close the alsa device before we try to reopen it as plughw

2007-09-18	Pierre Ossman
	4ed41f3: strtof() is a rather recent addition to C. Fall back to strtod() if it isn't
	aff22cf: NSIG seems to be more common than _NSIG.
	03d9863: Emulate lrintf with simple truncation if it isn't available.
	31dfb31: Make sure the header file is only included on linux (as this is a linux-only
	df1d347: NSIG is not defined by neither C99 nor POSIX so we can't rely on it.

2007-09-17	Lennart Poettering
	4cde507: add LADSPA sink than can be piggy-backed ontop of another sink
	7b4f981: print a message when we fall back on plughw
	8ff7d56: add a locale-independant pa_atof() implementation
	4cdf2ce: hide sig2str-test
	1ae473b: fall back to plughw: if hw: doesn't work
	26a1ae7: Rename pa_strsignal() to pa_sig2str(), since we return the symbolical signal name, not a human readable string. This follows the Solaris API of sig2str() a bit. Also, add all remaining signals to the list of signal names.
	d3b8985: drop a couple of WARNING prefixes in log messages, since we have pa_log_warn anyway for marking warnings especially
	19eb7eb: once.c is no longer POSIX specific. Since it is now considerably more advanced than it used to be, use it on windows, too
	7f9fea7: on Linu disable lazy binding altogether
	a1526f1: add missing initialization
	061e806: Add a special ltdl .so loader that avoids lazy frelocations during runtime
	2741685: use priority inheritance on mutexes where applicable

2007-09-16	Lennart Poettering
	61b90a0: add proper boolean type pa_bool_t
	116ddaa: use gcc const and pure function attributes wherever applicable
	35483ee: add a new module module-remap-sink which can be used to remap the channel maps of an already existant sink. one use case is to create a virtual sink that redirects stereo data to the rear speakers of a surround card.
	1d1eda6: add a "length" argument to the seek functions, as an optimization to request a certain block size if any data needs to be generated. this is merely a hint.
	5df7a85: split memblocks into multiples of the mempool tile size
	ac1ee4e: add new API pa_mempool_block_size_max() to query the maximum tile size
	fce8507: * add a new resampler "copy" which is does not change sample rates but copies data unmodified from input to output. 
	d079b48: properly define MAX/MIN macros
	87795b0: add missing header file changes for frame alignment apis
	e17fbf0: be a little bit more elaborate on the reason why we drop to software volume control if hw is not featureful enough for us
	0469c84: add frame alignment APIs; don't require memory to be writable when silencing it (required of the mmap modes drivers where the hw data needs to be silenced, although it is not writable to others)

2007-09-15	Lennart Poettering
	298d239: trivial typo
	8389264: count corked streams per sink/source and make pa_sink_used_by() return only the number of streams that are not corked. Introduce pa_sink_linked_by() returning the number of streams connected at all. This will allow suspending of sinks/sources when all streams connected to a sink are corked.

2007-09-14	Lennart Poettering
	5ae4eed: Move attaching/detaching from a pa_rtpoll into pa_sink proper, remove it from module-combine
	3396b65: simplify rt loops a bit by moving more code into pa_rtpoll. It is now possible to attach "work" functions to a pa_rtpoll_item, which will be called in each loop iteration. This allows us to hide the message processing in the RT loops and to drop the seperate sink_input->process hooks. Basically, only the driver-specific code remains in the RT loops.
	f0b9dce: explicitly destory TLS data before destroying TLS
	bf274cb: add two new macros PA_ONCE_BEGIN and PA_ONCE_END which allow usage of pa_once without declaring a function to be called

	8775309: fix two typos in reference count handling
	9be0d70: make newer gcc shut up

2007-09-12	Lennart Poettering

	cf3e9da: add missing config.h inclusion
	03f311a: reindent, and s/assert/pa_assert/g
	4137865: change pa_modargs_get_channel_map() to take an extra argument for specifying the name of the modargs attribute to parse
	d9c4c95: add new pa_pipe_close() API to close two fds at the same time
	7f92542: consolidate close() calls to pa_close(), and make sure on every occasion that we handle failures of close() sensibly

2007-09-11	Lennart Poettering
	54506ab: on systems where we know that POSIX shm is mapped to /dev/shm, add the ability to cleanup stale SHM segments. (Right now only Linux)
	d5bedbc: remaining s/assert/pa_assert/ and refcnt.h modernizations
	2988c3d: Rework core-error.c on top of PA_STATIC_TLS_DECLARE, the windows specific parts need to be moved to thread-win32.c
	abb18d9: explcitly initialize tls memory to NULL
	9c523e0: more modernizations, s/assert/pa_assert/g
	27f13b3: finish modernizations in pulse/, s/assert/pa_assert/g
	038e560: More s/assert/pa_assert/ modernizations
	391d09c: add 'wait' parameter to pa_rtpoll_run(), if zero pa_rtpoll_runn will only update the struct pollfd but not wait for an event
	597a1c4: port client libs to refcnt.h
	55d9fcb: add globally defined PA_PATH_SEP macro, replacing private per-file macros
	6ac66e4: add missing config.h includes
	e2e2ce7: Instead of including config.h from header files, check whether PACKAGE is defined and if not, fail (thus using PACKAGE as a check for inclusion of config.h)
	848a4d7: more s/assert/pa_assert/ modernizations

2007-09-10	Lennart Poettering
	9b0ab39: unify static TLS support, make use of gcc __thread attribute if available

	de21b54: add new API pa_threaded_mainloop_in_thread(), update test case for it
	a6f8b81: simple modernizations: s/assert/pa_assert
	6629886: make sure we send each memblock only once when recording, not twice
	d5caa02: minor cleanup
	a77158e: make the memchunk writeable before silencing it
	841fcb4: beef up comment
	98f9bd6: make sure that the device volume is properly read before we call pa_sink_put() and thus make the pa_sink available
	69ece66: add pulseaudio logo with text
	44e514c: update todo file a little
	6c1682c: hide a couple of files
	27c3bd4: document that the native amd64 atomic ops implementation is incomplete
	06db921: don't call pa_source_process_msg() for PA_SOURCE_MESSAGE_GET_LATENCY, since it makes querying the latency always fail

2007-09-10	Pierre Ossman
