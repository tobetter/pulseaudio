pulseaudio for Debian
---------------------

The pulseaudio executable is installed suid root. This is the recommended
configuration as it allows pulseaudio to run with realtime priority. After
grabbing the realtime capability, pulseaudio drops all other root
priviledges. Only users in the realtime group are granted realtime
priviledges in this way.
