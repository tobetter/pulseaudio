## Configuration file for the pulseaudio daemon. Default values are
## commented out.  Use either ; or # for commenting

# Extra verbositiy
; verbose = 0

## Daemonize after startup
; daemonize = 0

## Quit if startup fails
; fail = 1

## Renice the daemon to level -15 and try to get SCHED_FIFO
## scheduling. This a good idea if you hear annyoing noise in the
## playback. However, this is a certain security issue, since it works 
## when called SUID root only. root is dropped immediately after gaining
## the nice level and SCHED_FIFO scheduling on startup.
; high-priority = 0

## Disallow module loading after startup
; disallow-module-loading = 0

## Terminate the daemon after the last client quit and this time
## passed. Use a negative value to disable this feature.
; exit-idle-time = -1

## Unload autoloaded modules after being idle for this time 
; module-idle-time = 20

## Unload autoloaded sample cache entries after being idle for this time 
; scache-idle-time = 20

## The path were to look for dynamic shared objects (DSOs aka
## plugins).  You may specify more than one path seperated by
## colons. 
; dl-search-path = @PA_DLSEARCHPATH@

## The default script file to load. Specify an empty string for not
## loading a default script file. The 
; default-script-file = @PA_DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE@

## The default log target. Use either "stderr", "syslog" or
## "auto". The latter is equivalent to "sylog" in case daemonize is
## true, otherwise to "stderr".
; log-target = auto

## The resampling algorithm to use. Use one of src-sinc-best-quality,
## src-sinc-medium-quality, src-sinc-fastest, src-zero-order-hold,
## src-linear, trivial. See the documentation of libsamplerate for an
## explanation for the different methods. The method 'trivial' is the
## only algorithm implemented without usage of floating point
## numbers. If you're tight on CPU consider using this. On the other
## hand it has the worst quality of all.
; resample-method = sinc-fastest

## Create a PID file in /tmp/pulseaudio-$USER/pid. Of this is enabled
## you may use commands like "pulseaudio --kill" or "pulseaudio
## --check". If you are planning to start more than one pulseaudio
## process per user, you better disable this option since it
## effectively disables multiple instances.
; use-pid-file = 1

## Do not install the CPU load limit, even on platforms where it is
## supported. This option is useful when debugging/profiling 
## PulseAudio to disable disturbing SIGXCPU signals.

## Run the daemon as system-wide instance, requires root priviliges

## Resource limits, see getrlimit(2) for more information

## Default fragment settings, for device drivers that need this
; default-fragments = 4
